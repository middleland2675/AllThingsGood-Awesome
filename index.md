# Welcome to All THINGS GOOD & AWESOME | Powered by GitHub

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/middleland2675/AllThingsGood-Awesome/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for sharing your codes like in the section below:

## Sample markdown Codes: 
//section below  after --- are all in WINDOWS
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1 : Largest FONT 
## Header 2 : Medium FONT
### Header 3 : Smaller FONT

- Bulleted just by using - xxx
- List just by using - yyy 

1. Numbered just by using Num. xxx
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

Sample Testing:

![NASA](put URL here)
```
//END OF MARKDOWN

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/middleland2675/AllThingsGood-Awesome/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

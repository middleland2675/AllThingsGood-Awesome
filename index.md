# Welcome to All THINGS GOOD & AWESOME | Powered by GitHub

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/middleland2675/AllThingsGood-Awesome/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for sharing your codes like in the section below:

## Sample markdown Codes: 
// Cannot use comments in GITHUB
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1 : Largest FONT 
## Header 2 : Medium FONT
### Header 3 : Smaller FONT

- Bulleted just by using - xxx
- List just by using - yyy 

1. Numbered just by using Num. xxx
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ DON'T work in mark down:
*This text will be italic* / _This will also be italic_ (single underscore)
**This text will be bold** / __This will also be bold__ (DOUBLE underscore)
_You **can** combine them_

Use `Code` to show codes
Example of showing codes in markdown: > `aws -- version`

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

Sample Testing:
[My Webpage](in mark down, url will be seen in clear)
![NASA](put URL here)
```
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your *Pages* site will use the **layout and styles** from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/middleland2675/AllThingsGood-Awesome/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the **Jekyll** `_config.yml` configuration file.
